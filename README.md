##Skills
### Proactive
Most of my professional work has been Freelance. Being in charge of my own time and work schedule has led me to become a highly proactive individual. I understand the importance of consistently improving skills in order to get regular, higher quality and more enjoyable work. This quality and "Learning how to learn" (one of the core values within our training at Makers Academy) has become an integral part of my coding practice.

### Team Player
I play team sports. I play in bands. I both curate and assist on big and small scale events. These activities have led me to appreciate diverse teams and respect each person's views as they lead to better quality outputs. I am a confident communicator in all aspects - presentations, checking in, asking questions, speaking up and welcoming feedback for the betterment of a project. This greatly benefited my coding practice at Makers Academy, where we coded in teams and adhered to XP values. It included producing clear verbal and written communication, commit messages, branch naming conventions, and defining critical issues needing to be resolved.

### Stays Calm & Carries On!
Through my previous work of audio engineering, running events, and DJing I learned to become adaptable in hectic and fluctuating environments. I developed a strong ability to remain calm and quickly resolve situations. All those roles required me to follow the signal flow and use the process of elimination to solve problems - the same skill used when debugging code. I am able to calmly follow the flow of data, narrow down the possibilities, and not make rash decisions.
